# Prepr

Prepr is a web application for those who spend a lot of time making meal plans on a weekly basis. Search and save recipes submitted by others or submit your own. Add ingredients for a recipe to a shopping list with a single click. With repeat use, lists will become organized by the isle in which an item is located in your local grocery store.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install gems with:

```
bundle install
```

Create the database:
```
rake db:create
```

Migrate changes:
```
rake db:migrate
```

If examples are desired, seed the database:
```
rake db:seed
```

Make sure tests pass:
```
rake
```
